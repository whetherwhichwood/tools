name: new-client
description: Scaffolds a new client and/or project workspace under clients/ using the nested client → project model. Use whenever someone says "set up a new client", "new project", "scaffold ACME", "add a project for an existing client", or is starting work that needs its own isolated folder, context, and artefact directories. Creates a shared client.md (relationship-level facts) and a per-project context.md (engagement state) so multiple projects can be isolated yet linked under one client.
version: 2.0.0
argument-hint: <CLIENT> [PROJECT]

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

*Expected: a client name, optionally followed by a project name - e.g. `ACME` or `ACME PaymentPortal`. If no input is provided, ask: "What's the client name, and what should we call the first project? (e.g. `ACME PaymentPortal`)"*

# New Client / Project Scaffolder

This skill creates the folder structure and context files for a new piece of work using the **nested client → project model**. It supports three relationships:

| Scenario | What to create |
|---|---|
| New client, new project | A new `CLIENT/` with `client.md` + a `PROJECT/` with `context.md` |
| New project for an existing client | A new `PROJECT/` under the existing `CLIENT/`; reuse the existing `client.md` |
| New client only (project named later) | A `CLIENT/` with `client.md`; prompt for the first project |

---

## Step 1 - Resolve and validate the names

- **CLIENT** - uppercase the folder name (e.g. `ACME`, `GLOBEX`). This is the relationship.
- **PROJECT** - TitleCase or kebab-case, the user's choice (e.g. `PaymentPortal`, `mobile-app`). This is one engagement.

**Validate before creating anything (security - these names become file paths).** Allow only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. **Reject** any name that contains `/`, `\`, `..`, a leading `-`, whitespace, control characters, or that looks like an absolute path - these could escape the `clients/` directory. If a name fails, do not run `mkdir`; ask the user for a clean name. Every path you create must stay inside `clients/`. See *Input Validation & Sanitisation* in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Before creating anything, **check what already exists**:

```
find clients -maxdepth 2 -type d 2>/dev/null
```

- If `clients/CLIENT/` already exists → do **not** recreate `client.md`. Add the new `PROJECT/` only, and say so.
- If `clients/CLIENT/PROJECT/` already exists → stop and ask whether to overwrite or pick a different name. Never silently overwrite.
- If no project name was given → create the client level, then ask for the first project name before finishing.

## Step 2 - Create the structure

```
clients/
  CLIENT/
    client.md                ← shared: stakeholders, billing, commercial terms, history
    PROJECT/
      context.md             ← per-engagement: phase, sprint, open risks, last artefact
      project-artefacts/     ← intake summaries, charters, risk scans, PRDs, discovery
      sprint-artefacts/      ← sprint SOWs, sprint reports, release checklists
      meeting-notes/         ← meeting minutes
      user-stories/          ← epics and story files
```

Create directories with `mkdir -p`, then write the two context files using the templates below.

---

## Step 3 - Write `client.md` (shared, relationship-level)

Only create this if it does not already exist. Fill in what the user gave you; mark unknowns `[TBC]`.

```markdown
# CLIENT - Client Profile

**Created:** [today's date]
**Status:** Active

## Relationship
- Account owner: [PM name or role - TBC]
- Commercial model: [Retainer / T&M / Fixed-price - TBC]
- Master agreement / SOW reference: [TBC]
- Billing contact: [TBC]

## Key Stakeholders
| Name / Role | Responsibility | Contact |
|---|---|---|
| [Sponsor] | Budget authority, final decisions | [TBC] |
| [Day-to-day contact] | Approvals, coordination | [TBC] |

## Projects
| Project | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [PROJECT] | Pre-project | Active |

## History / Notes
- [Anything that spans all of this client's projects - preferences, past engagements, sensitivities]
```

---

## Step 4 - Write `context.md` (per-project, engagement state)

Always create this for the new project.

```markdown
# CLIENT / PROJECT - Active Context

**Client:** CLIENT
**Project:** PROJECT
**Created:** [today's date]
**Phase:** Pre-project
**Last updated:** [today's date]

## Current State
- Sprint: [N/A yet]
- Sprint dates: [TBC]
- Sprint goal: [TBC]

## Artefacts Produced
| Date | Artefact | Path |
|---|---|---|
| | (none yet) | |

## Open Risks
| # | Risk | Priority | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| | (none logged yet) | | |

## Open Decisions / Questions
- [TBC]

## Next Step
- Run `/triage` or `/pm` on the first stakeholder input for this project.
```

---

## Step 5 - Confirm and hand off

After creating everything, confirm exactly what was made:

> Created `clients/CLIENT/PROJECT/` with `context.md` and four artefact folders.
> [If client was new:] Also created `clients/CLIENT/client.md`.
> [If client existed:] Reused existing `clients/CLIENT/client.md` - added `PROJECT/` as a new engagement.

Then remind:

> `clients/` is excluded from version control - all client data stays local only.
> When you start work, `/pm` will read both `client.md` and this project's `context.md` to pick up where you left off.

If a client was created without a project, ask for the first project name now and complete Step 2-4 for it.
