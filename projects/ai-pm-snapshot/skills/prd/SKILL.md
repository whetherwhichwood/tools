name: prd
description: 'Writes a Product Requirements Document (PRD) or Business Requirements Document (BRD) from discovery findings, a project brief, or raw stakeholder input. Use whenever someone says "write the PRD", "write the BRD", "document the requirements", "we need a requirements document", "turn this into a spec", or has completed discovery and needs requirements formally documented before build begins. A PRD defines what to build and why - from the product/user perspective. A BRD defines what the business needs the solution to achieve - from the business/stakeholder perspective. Both serve the same purpose: give the team a single agreed source of truth so everyone builds the same thing. Use this skill after discovery, before user stories or design begins.'

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

*If no input is provided above, ask: "Please share your discovery findings, project charter, or feature brief. Also let me know if you need a PRD (product/engineering audience) or a BRD (business/stakeholder audience)."*

---

If unclear whether PRD or BRD is needed, ask: "Is this for the engineering/product team (PRD) or for business stakeholders and sign-off (BRD)?" Default to PRD for product/tech projects, BRD for business change or procurement.

# What to Gather First

| Input | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Project name + goal | Yes | Anchors the whole document |
| Discovery findings or brief | Yes | Without this, requirements are invented not elicited |
| Target users / stakeholders | Yes | Requirements without a user are just features |
| Known constraints | No | Technical, budget, regulatory - shapes what's feasible |
| Out-of-scope items | No | Explicitly excluding items prevents scope creep |

If discovery findings aren't available, ask: "Has discovery been done? If not, requirements written now will likely change - consider running discovery first."

# Output Template

Use this structure. PRD and BRD share the same template - when producing a BRD, read `brd-guide.md` for the differences (it adds a Business Case Summary section).

## [PRD / BRD] - [Project Name]

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** [Today] | **Author:** [PM name or role]
**Status:** Draft / Under Review / Approved
**Approvers:** [Names or roles who must sign off]

### 1. Purpose & Background
[2-3 sentences. Why does this project exist? What problem does it solve? What triggered it?]

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Success Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| [What we want to achieve] | [How we'll measure it] | [The number or threshold] |

Goals without metrics are wishes. Every goal needs at least one measurable outcome.

### 3. Users & Stakeholders

| Role | Description | Primary need |
|---|---|---|
| [User type] | [Who they are] | [What they need from this solution] |

### 4. Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions** (believed true - must be validated before build):
- [assumed] [Statement]

**Constraints** (fixed - cannot change):
- [e.g. Must comply with GDPR]
- [e.g. Must integrate with existing Salesforce instance]

### 5. Functional Requirements

Group by feature area or user journey. Number every requirement - it makes review and traceability easier.

#### [Feature Area 1]

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | [Who can do what, under what conditions, to what outcome] | Must / Should / Could | [Any clarification] |
| FR-02 | | | |

**Priority guide (MoSCoW):**
- **Must** - without this, the product fails. Non-negotiable.
- **Should** - high value, include if possible. Workaround exists.
- **Could** - nice to have. Cut first if time or budget is tight.
- *(Won't = out of scope - list in section 7)*

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | Performance | [e.g. Page load time] | [e.g. < 2 seconds] |
| NFR-02 | Security | [e.g. Authentication] | [e.g. MFA required for admin roles] |
| NFR-03 | Accessibility | [e.g. WCAG compliance] | [e.g. WCAG 2.1 AA] |
| NFR-04 | Availability | [e.g. Uptime] | [e.g. 99.5% during business hours] |

### 7. Out of Scope
Explicitly stating what is NOT included is as important as what is. Every item here is a conversation that happened upfront.

- [Item explicitly excluded]
- [Item explicitly excluded]

### 8. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [e.g. Salesforce API access] | Technical | IT | Confirmed / Pending / Blocked |

### 9. Open Questions
Requirements that cannot be finalised until these are answered:

| # | Question | Who Can Answer | By When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | [Unresolved question affecting requirements] | [Role] | [Date] |

### 10. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Status | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Product Owner / Sponsor | | Approved / Changes requested | |
| Tech Lead | | Approved / Changes requested | |
| [Other stakeholder] | | | |
