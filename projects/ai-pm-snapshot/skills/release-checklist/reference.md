- **F1 / F2 - FIN-443 and FIN-461 not complete** - QA still in progress. Owner: Priya S. Must be resolved before release window opens.
- **T2 - QA sign-off incomplete** - FIN-443 (scheduling edge cases) and FIN-461 (webhook retry logic) have no QA sign-off. Owner: Priya S.
- **T5 - No load testing completed** - Background job CPU spike risk is unvalidated. Owner: Tom W. Must run load test or explicitly accept risk before GO.
- **O4 - Rollback plan not reviewed by tech lead** - An unreviewed rollback plan is not a rollback plan. Owner: Marcus R. Must review and sign off before release.
- **O7 - Infrastructure scaling unconfirmed** - Background jobs could spike CPU under load. Owner: Tom W. Confirm scaling or link to load test result.
- **A3 - QA lead sign-off incomplete** - Only partial sign-off received. Full sign-off required before GO. Owner: Priya S.

### Verdict

> **NO-GO**

This release has 11 FAIL items and 23 UNCONFIRMED items. The release is not ready to ship on Friday 30 May. The two critical paths are: (1) QA sign-off on FIN-443 and FIN-461 must be completed, and (2) legal must be consulted on payment data storage before code goes to production. Recommend a 48-hour hold to resolve the blockers - reschedule to Monday 2 June 2026 at the earliest, pending blocker resolution.
