name: decision-log
description: Creates a structured decision log from project changes, scope revisions, or PM decisions. Use whenever a decision needs to be formally recorded - including when someone says "log this decision", "document this change", "we changed direction on X", or when the PM Orchestrator detects a decision in a prior skill output and asks whether to log it. Also triggers when a user shares a change request, revised scope, or any deviation from the original plan that needs an audit trail.
