# Reference: Worked Example

Use this to calibrate output quality - especially for translating raw Jira data into plain-English PM judgements rather than restating numbers.

## Input

> Sprint 12 - Day 6 of 10
>
> Committed: 42 points across 14 stories
> Completed: 18 points (6 stories Done)
> In Progress: 12 points (4 stories)
> To Do: 12 points (4 stories)
> Blocked: 8 points (2 stories - both blocked on API keys from a third-party vendor)
>
> Scope added mid-sprint: 2 stories (6 points) added on Day 3 - both assigned to the same developer
> Bugs raised this sprint: 3 (1 critical, 2 minor)
> Velocity last 3 sprints: 38, 35, 40 points
>
> Team: 4 developers, 1 QA. QA has not started testing - waiting for stories to clear In Progress.

## Correct Output

# Executive Summary

Sprint 12 is at significant risk of not completing to plan. Two blocked stories are holding 19% of committed points, and a QA bottleneck is building as work accumulates without being tested. With 4 days remaining, the team needs to unblock the vendor dependency today or formally defer those stories to Sprint 13.

# Delivery Status

- **Status:** 🔴 Red
- **Sprint Confidence:** 55%
- **Forecast:** 9-10 of 14 stories likely complete
- **Risk:** High

# Top 3 PM Priorities

1. Chase the third-party vendor for API keys today - both blocked stories need this to move, and at 8 points they represent nearly a fifth of the sprint commitment.
2. Get QA started on the 6 completed stories immediately - waiting until all dev work is done will compress testing into the last 2 days and increase defect risk.
3. Decide now whether the 2 mid-sprint additions stay in scope - adding 6 points on Day 3 without removing anything is the most likely cause of a miss.

---

# Main Risks

1. **Blocked stories may not unblock in time.** If the vendor doesn't respond by end of Day 7, those 8 points cannot realistically complete. Deferring is safer than hoping.
2. **QA compression.** With 6 stories ready to test and no testing started, QA is heading into a crunch. The critical bug raised this sprint has not been verified fixed.
3. **Scope add without trade-off.** The 2 stories added on Day 3 sit with one developer who already had assignments. That person is likely overloaded.

---

# Actions Today

1. PM to contact vendor directly for API key ETA - do not wait for the developer to chase.
2. QA to begin testing the 6 completed stories today, prioritising the critical bug fix first.
3. PM to review the 2 mid-sprint additions with the team lead - confirm they stay in or formally defer one to Sprint 13.

---

# Questions for Standup

1. What is the current vendor ETA for the API keys - and who last chased them?
2. Can QA begin testing the completed stories today, or is there an environment issue blocking that?
3. Is the developer assigned to the mid-sprint additions on track, or is that work at risk?

---

# Leadership Update

Sprint 12 is tracking behind plan due to a third-party vendor dependency blocking two stories and a QA bottleneck forming in the second half of the sprint. The team is focused on unblocking these today; a scope trade-off decision may be needed by end of week to protect the sprint goal.

---

## Why This Output Is Good

**Numbers are translated, not repeated.** "8 points blocked" becomes "19% of committed scope held by one vendor dependency." A sponsor doesn't need to know the point count - they need to know the business impact.

**The QA bottleneck is named explicitly.** Raw Jira data shows QA hasn't started. The output names what will happen if that continues: testing compressed into 2 days, defect risk increases. That's a decision the PM needs to make today, not at the sprint review.

**Confidence is honest.** 55% is lower than many PMs would report at the halfway point. But two blocked stories plus a scope add without trade-off makes optimism unjustified. Hiding this until Day 9 is worse than naming it on Day 6.

**Actions are specific and owned.** "PM to contact vendor directly" - not "escalate the blocker." A standup action with no owner is not an action.
