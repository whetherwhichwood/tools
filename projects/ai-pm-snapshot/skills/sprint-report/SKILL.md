## Input

$ARGUMENTS

*If no input is provided above, ask: "Please paste your Jira sprint data - burndown, velocity, ticket statuses, or a screenshot description. Which day of the sprint are we on?"*

**If Jira is not connected** (MCP tool unavailable): do not fabricate ticket data. Tell the user Jira isn't connected and ask them to paste the board state (ticket statuses, assignees, blockers). The report format is identical - only the data source changes. See *Connection Failsafe* in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

---

Assess: burndown trend, completed vs committed, blocked/aging tickets, scope changes, QA bottlenecks, overloaded owners, and velocity trend.

# FINAL ACTION (MANDATORY)

After generating the report, ask the user where they want it saved:

> "Where would you like me to save this? I can save it locally or push it directly to any platform you have connected via MCP."
>
> **Local**
> 1. **Local file** - saved to `clients/CLIENT/sprint-artefacts/YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-N-report.md`
>
> **Connected platforms (via MCP)**
> 2. **Confluence** - published as a new page (I'll ask for your domain, space, and parent page)
> 3. **Google Drive** - saved as a new Doc (I'll ask for the folder)
> 4. **Notion** - created as a new page (I'll ask for your workspace and parent page)
>
> **No save**
> 5. **Clipboard only** - leave it here for you to copy manually

Do not save or publish anything until the user confirms the destination.

**If Confluence is chosen:**
1. Ask for the Confluence cloud domain, space key, and parent page title or ID
2. Resolve the space ID using `getConfluenceSpaces` if needed
3. Use `createConfluencePage` with:
   - `cloudId`: as provided by the user
   - `spaceId`: resolved from the space key
   - `parentId`: as provided by the user
   - `title`: `{Project} Sprint Report - {Sprint Name}, Day {N} ({YYYY-MM-DD})`
   - `contentFormat`: `markdown`
   - `body`: the full report markdown
4. Return the live Confluence page URL to the user
