name: risk-scan
description: Identifies, evaluates, and recommends mitigation strategies for project risks across any phase of delivery. Use whenever a PM needs continuous risk discovery or decision support - including when someone says "analyse the risks on this project", "do a full risk analysis", "we need a risk review", "what risks should I be tracking right now", "update the risk picture", or shares project context and wants a structured risk assessment. It runs at any depth, from a fast initial pre-screen right after triage (Low depth) through to ongoing risk discovery across all project phases (Discovery through Deployment), adjusting depth to how much time the PM has. Use it at any phase gate, after significant scope changes, or when the risk landscape feels unclear.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

*If no input is provided above, ask: "Please share the project context - name, phase, timeline, known risks, and any recent changes."*

---

# Before Starting - What to Gather

Extract or ask for these before writing anything:

| Input | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Project context | Yes | Scope, timeline, stakeholders, goals - without this, risks are generic |
| Current phase | Yes | Risk profile changes by phase - read `phase-guide.md` for phase-specific profiles (especially Testing and Deployment) |
| Known constraints | No | Fixed deadlines, budget caps - these turn risks into near-certainties |
| Recent changes | No | Scope, team, or requirement changes are a primary risk source |
| Depth needed | No | Default Medium - see depth table below |

If project context or current phase is missing, ask before proceeding.

---

# Depth

| Depth | When | Risks | Sections to include |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low | "quick", "brief", initial pre-screen after triage | 3-5 | Risk register + verdict only |
| Medium | default | 5-8 | Full output except Prioritisation Reasoning |
| High | "thorough", "board report" | 8-12 | Full output including Prioritisation Reasoning |

> Use **Low** depth as a fast initial pre-screen right after triage and before the charter. Use Medium or High for ongoing scans at phase gates. (This pre-screen mode replaces the separate initial-risk-scan skill that was consolidated into these depth modes.)

# Scoring

Score every risk across four dimensions - each one changes the response, not just the priority colour.

**Likelihood:** H = more likely than not / M = possible / L = unlikely but real

**Impact:** H = project fails or major rework / M = delay or cost increase / L = minor inconvenience

**Detectability:** Easy = clear leading indicators / Moderate = needs active monitoring / Hard = little or no warning before it triggers

**Velocity:** Fast = escalates in hours / Medium = days / Slow = weeks

**Priority from Likelihood × Impact:**

| | High Impact | Low Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **High Likelihood** | 🔴 Act now | 🟡 Monitor actively |
| **Low Likelihood** | 🟡 Prepare contingency | 🟢 Log and revisit |

Every Hard-detectability risk needs a **trigger signal** - a specific observable event that tells you the risk has activated. Without one, nobody knows when to act. (Trigger signals are recorded in the Top Risks - Detail section, included from Medium depth up. At Low depth, either keep flagged risks to Easy/Moderate detectability or note the trigger inline in the register.)

**Response types:** Mitigate / Transfer / Avoid / Accept / Escalate. "Monitor" alone is not a response.

## RISK ANALYSIS

**Project:** [Name] | **Phase:** [Phase] | **Date:** [Today]
**Depth:** Low / Medium / High | **Recent changes assessed:** Yes / No

---

### Overall Verdict

🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low

[2-3 sentences: dominant risk theme, whether the project is healthy for its current phase, what needs to change if not.]

---

### Risk Register

| # | Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Detectability | Velocity | Response | Owner | Proximity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | [Event - not a label] | Delivery/Technical/Stakeholder/Business | H/M/L | H/M/L | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | Easy/Moderate/Hard | Fast/Medium/Slow | [Type] | [Role] | [Week 1-2/Month 1/Later] |

---

### Top Risks - Detail
This should be in table format. 
*(every 🔴 risk; if none, top 2 🟡)*

**R[N] - [Name]**
*What could happen:* [Specific bad outcome]
*Why exposed:* [What makes this real for this project]
*Trigger signal:* [Observable event that confirms the risk has activated - required for Hard detectability]
*Velocity:* [How fast it escalates and why]
*Risk score:* [Qualitative one-liner]
*Action:* [Who does what by when]

---

### Validation Experiments
*(Medium/High depth only - High-impact risks where the outcome is genuinely uncertain)*

| Risk | Experiment | What We're Testing | Expected Learning | By |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | Spike/Prototype/Pilot/Data pull | [Assumption being tested] | [What we'll know] | [Hard date] |

---

### Stakeholder Summary
*(Medium/High depth - written for sponsor, not PM)*

> "We are at risk of [outcome] due to [cause]. Recommended action: [next step]."

One line per top risk. Plain language. No jargon.

---

### Prioritisation Reasoning
*(High depth only)*

Explain why top risks are ranked as they are - especially where velocity or detectability overrides a lower probability score.

---

### Decisions Needed

| Decision | Owner | By |
|---|---|---|
| [Requires authority above PM] | [Role] | [Date] |
