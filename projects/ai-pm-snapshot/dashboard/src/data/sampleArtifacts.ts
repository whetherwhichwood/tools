    `## Triage - Requirement Intake Summary

**Request Summary:** Enterprise clients discover failed payments reactively (via customer calls) rather than proactively. Sarah is asking for real-time payment failure notifications.

**Likely Business Goal:** Reduce client churn and support burden by giving enterprise customers visibility into payment failures before their end-customers complain.

**Primary Stakeholder Need:** Enterprise clients need to know about payment failures the moment they occur.

**What Is Clear**
- Trigger event: payment failure
- Audience: enterprise clients
- Deadline: 6 weeks (Salesforce conference)
- Budget: ~$80k

**Missing Information**
- Channels (email / SMS / webhook / in-app)?
- Events beyond failures (partial, reversals, retries)?
- Who receives the notification?
- Existing infra to build on?
- Is 6 weeks for MVP or full feature?

**Risks / Concerns**
- "Real-time" undefined (30s vs 5min)
- 6 weeks is aggressive
- $80k may not cover full scope

**Intake Classification:** New Feature - Medium/High complexity.

**Recommended Next Step:** Run a discovery session with Sarah and the tech lead.`),

    `## Project Charter - Finwave Real-Time Payment Notifications
**Date:** 2026-05-29 | **Version:** 1.0

### Purpose
Enterprise clients discover payment failures reactively, causing churn and support overhead. This project delivers real-time payment event notifications so clients can act before their customers notice.

### Scope
**In scope**
- Email notifications for payment failure events
- In-app notification centre
- Configurable recipients per client account
- Failure, retry, resolution events

**Out of scope**
- SMS / push (post-MVP)
- Webhook delivery (Phase 2)
- End-user notifications
- Custom email templates

### Top Risks
| Risk | L | I | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Event streaming infra not in place | M | H | Spike in Week 1 |
| Scope expansion to more channels | H | M | Lock in charter |
| 6-week deadline for MVP only | H | H | Confirm with Sarah |

### Approvals
| Role | Name |
|---|---|
| Sponsor | Sarah Chen |
| Project Manager | |
| Tech Lead | Marcus Reid |`),

    `## Discovery Findings

**The Real Problem**
Enterprise clients have no proactive signal for payment failures; they learn from their own customers. The root need is a timely, configurable alert, not a dashboard.

**What Success Looks Like**
Notification delivered within 60 seconds of a payment event, to the right account contacts.

**Key Findings**
- Kafka event layer already exists (reuse it)
- MVP = email + in-app; in-app is a stretch
- Recipients configured at account level, not per user

**Conflicts**
- Sarah wants webhooks soon; engineering wants email-only for MVP

**Still Unknown**
- Email delivery failure handling (retry vs alert)
- Notification history retention`),

  "meeting-notes": exec("s-meeting", "meeting-notes",
    `## Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 2026-06-01 | **Attendees:** Sarah Chen, Marcus Reid, Priya Sharma, PM

**Summary**
Kick-off for real-time notifications. MVP = email + in-app; Kafka event layer confirmed; the 6-week deadline covers email only, in-app is stretch.

**Decisions Made**
- MVP = email only; in-app stretch
- Recipients configurable at account level
- Events: payment failed, retried, resolved
- "Real-time" = within 60 seconds

**Action Items**
| Who | What | By When |
|---|---|---|
| Marcus | Confirm Kafka consumer for payment events | 2026-06-03 |
| PM | Update charter, circulate for sign-off | 2026-06-02 |
| Priya | Define QA approach for delivery testing | 2026-06-05 |

**Open Questions**
- Email delivery failure: retry or alert?
- Notification history view required?`),

    `## Technical Feasibility Review

**Plain-English Summary**
Kafka event bus to a new notification microservice, emails via SendGrid, Redis to prevent duplicate sends on replay, feature flag for per-client rollout.

**Delivery Implications**
- Timeline: 6 weeks feasible for email (Kafka already in place)
- Scope: Redis dedup adds ~3 days not in the original estimate
- Third-party: SendGrid API key needed in prod before Week 3

**Risks**
| # | Risk | L | I | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Redis not in prod stack | M | H | Blocks delivery if delayed |
| R2 | SendGrid rate limits at peak | L | M | Needs load test |

**Questions for Marcus**
1. Is Redis provisioned in prod?
2. SendGrid tier vs enterprise volume?
3. Feature flag vs account-settings interaction?

**Verdict: Feasible with conditions.** Resolve Redis provisioning before the Week 3 build start.`),
