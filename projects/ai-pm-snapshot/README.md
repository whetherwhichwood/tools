## Why AI PM Assistant?

Generic AI gives you text. AI PM Assistant gives you structure.

Each skill encodes a proven PM workflow - intake triage, risk analysis, discovery, PRDs, user stories, sprint planning - and walks Claude through it step by step. You get the rigour of a senior PM built into your terminal, not sitting in a workshop somewhere.

The result: decision-ready artefacts in minutes, not hours.

---

## How It Works

**Skills** are the building blocks. Each skill file gives Claude a defined workflow, output format, and style rules for a specific PM task. Skills are loaded automatically when relevant.

**Commands** are slash commands that invoke a skill directly (`/triage`, `/prd`, `/stories`). The **PM Orchestrator** (`/pm`) reads your input, picks the right skill, and chains them in delivery order.

**Skill chain:**

```
Raw request → /triage → /risk-scan → /charter → /discovery → /prd → /stories → /sprint-sow → /sprint-planning → /release-checklist
                                                                                                                          ↕
                                                                                                                  /decision-log (runs after any skill that surfaces a decision)
```

After any command completes, the next logical skill is suggested - just follow the prompts.

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Erica-J-01/ai-pm.git
cd ai-pm
claude .
```

Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` automatically, and registers slash commands from `.claude/commands/`. No configuration needed to start.

## Connecting Your Tools (MCP) - optional

Everything works out of the box as a text-in, markdown-out tool. **Connecting your tools is optional** - it just removes copy-paste: skills can then read live Jira data and publish straight to Confluence, Google Drive, Notion, or Gmail.

**If nothing is connected**, skills fall back gracefully: they ask you to paste ticket data (instead of pulling it) and render clean markdown or save locally (instead of publishing). You never lose output - see the *Connection Failsafe* in [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md).

**Two ways to connect:**

1. **Claude connectors (simplest).** Enable the Atlassian (Jira/Confluence), Google Drive, Notion, and Gmail connectors in Claude. The skills are pre-wired to the resulting tool names - no config files needed.

2. **Self-hosted MCP servers.** Copy the template and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
   ```
   Put real credentials in environment variables (referenced as `${VAR}` in `.mcp.json`) or a `.env` file. Both `.mcp.json` and `.env` are gitignored - **credentials are never committed.**

   Get an Atlassian API token from `id.atlassian.com` → Security → API tokens.

> Personal overrides and secrets belong in `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.env`, or `.mcp.json` - all gitignored. Never hardcode tokens in tracked files.

**When to use:**  
- A timeline, scope, budget, or architecture decision has been made and needs an audit trail

- You need a formal change record to share with stakeholders or attach to a charter

**Command:** `/decision-log`

**Example:**
```
/decision-log
We were planning a 3-month delivery but the client moved the go-live to 6 weeks.
Engineering flagged this as a scope risk. We also dropped the reporting module from MVP.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>retrospective</strong> - Sprint/project retro with owned action items</summary>

**What it does:**  
Facilitates a retro (format, agenda, prompts) or turns raw retro notes into a structured summary: what went well, what didn't (as blameless themes), and action items each with a single owner and a date. Reviews whether the last retro's actions actually got done.

**When to use:**  
- End of a sprint or project phase  
- Turning a messy retro board into owned next steps

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>stakeholder-update</strong> - Audience-ready status update</summary>

**What it does:**  
Translates delivery detail into a concise update for a specific audience (sponsor, exec, client, or team): RAG status, progress as outcomes, what's next, risks, and any decisions needed. Drafts it as an email, Confluence page, or copy-ready text.

**When to use:**  
- Weekly or milestone stakeholder comms  
- Briefing a sponsor or client on progress  
- Turning a sprint report into something a non-delivery audience will read

**Command:** `/stakeholder-update`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>roadmap</strong> - Now/Next/Later or quarterly roadmap</summary>

**What it does:**  
Sequences initiatives into themes and time horizons with dependencies and honest confidence levels (near-term firm, later directional). Produces a Now/Next/Later or quarterly view, plus what's explicitly parked and why.

**When to use:**  
- Communicating direction to stakeholders  
- Sequencing a backlog into themes after a charter or PRD  
- Quarterly or half-year planning

**Command:** `/roadmap`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>budget-tracker</strong> - Spend vs budget with burn-rate forecast</summary>

**What it does:**  
Compares spend to date against the charter budget, forecasts cost at completion, and flags overrun early with a RAG verdict, variance drivers, and recommended actions. Built to catch problems while there's still time to act.

**When to use:**  
- Monthly or per-sprint budget check-ins  
- Answering "are we on budget?"  
- Spotting burn-rate risk before it becomes an overrun

**Command:** `/budget-tracker`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>onboarding</strong> - Starter brief for a new joiner</summary>

**What it does:**  
Synthesises a project's existing artefacts and context into a one-page orientation for a new team member: what the project is, where it stands, who's who, what to read first, decisions already made, live risks, and a role-specific first-week checklist.

**When to use:**  
- A new dev, QA, PM, or designer joins an in-flight project  
- Bringing someone up to speed without a series of meetings  
- Capturing project knowledge in one place

**Command:** `/onboarding`

</details>

## PM Orchestrator

Not sure which skill to use? The `/pm` command analyses your input and routes it automatically.

```
/pm Here's a message from my client - [paste anything]
```

Claude will read the input, identify the right skill (or chain of skills), and ask for your approval before running each step. You stay in control.

## Client Data

The `clients/` directory is excluded from this repo via `.gitignore`. All client artefacts live there locally and are never committed to version control.

After cloning, create your own client folder:

```bash
mkdir -p clients/YOUR_CLIENT/project-artefacts
```

Skills will ask you where to save each artefact. You can save locally, or push directly to Confluence, Jira, Google Drive, Notion, or Gmail if you have those connected via MCP.

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b skill/your-skill-name`
3. Follow the existing skill structure (`SKILL.md` + `reference.md` minimum)
4. Open a pull request

**Skill authoring checklist:**

- `name`, `description`, `version`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools` in frontmatter
- `## Input` block with `$ARGUMENTS` and a fallback ask if empty
- What to Gather First (inputs required before generating)
- Output template - exact structure Claude will follow
- Save prompt following the Saving Artefacts rules in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- A `reference.md` worked example (input → output) where helpful

See any existing skill for the pattern.
